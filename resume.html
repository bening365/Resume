    <h1 align-items="center">WHO AM I?</h1>
    <P>        You will catch me drinking a chocolate milkshake at a Diner or snacking the party plate hummus in the corner. I love to connect, especially getting to know people through my humor. My language barrier is what they found amusing, I find it humorous. I used to have a couple of Hedgehog as pets. Now, this sounds like a dating app, I am a 5'4 inches. 

      </P>
    <P>          Life is a picture of learning and mistake, just like a painting will not work without shades of color.  Patient and trying to be better than today is the motto. Was that the note I stick on the fridge? This is the part where you see the sign "let's connect !". 
    </P>

                   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always liked nature. Growing up climbing cherry trees, hoping that there were more cherries to share.  I guess climbing trees wasn't an option anymore when it came to adulthood. I wonder if that tree is still there, waiting for kids to drop their bike and rush like it was time for dinner. 
                   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad I was that kid. It wasn't the taste of the cherry that I miss. It was the view and the relief that came with it. A memory that is imprinted in my mind when I saw the sunlight, glistening on my friend’s face as they yelled: "on the top left, not my left, your left!”. This memory has taught me everything is beautiful, I just have to see it from a different view.  
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My love for nature brought me to Hawaii. It was mesmerizing to see how most of the "sand" particles were plastic. The fact that so many of our everyday products ended up in the oceans was heart-breaking. I can give you a smile, but I can't give you the feeling of what mother nature has suffered.</div>

                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   What better way to spend a summer break than to take a Film Program at NYFA! I knew that I possessed the creativity and skill which made me want to  write a story and make it come to life.  For my final project, I wrote a story about Speed dating (CupidOu)on how hard it is to find a date in NYC.  <p>*Can you relate?</p>
                       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was fun! It was a lot of coffee, late night talks and hard-work, but in the end, it was worth the time. Finding the right actors wasn’t easy. I learned from my past productions that I have to individually focus on the actors. I had to go through the storyboard with every actor that was involved. I had to make them feel important and comfortable in the role. In CupidOu's production, I wanted it to be fun and playful. I knew that speed dating would be awesome to write about. Thank you to all the people that were involved in my production.

                             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  “I was so nervous, but I knew everything would be okay”. This was my first agency that I interned for in NYC. It’s a women-based agency yet, I felt like I learned much more than I would. It felt like I was surrounded by powerful women that inspired me to challenge myself every day. Every lunch we shared a glimpse of each other’s lives, plans for the weekends and dress shopping for Summer weddings. 

                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got a chance to understand how Public Relations operates and how powerful Public relations is. One experience I knew I wouldn’t get from any other place is the way the agency communicated, prepared and executed PR campaigns.

                              <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can’t thank you enough for the opportunity you gave me. Thank you, Sarah and the team, :)

                               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating a website had been on my mind for some time. So, I set a goal to put aside a percentage of my money from my past and current internships to pay for a course to take a front-end development class during summer 2019 at General Assembly in NYC.   
                            
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting that as a goal and taking the course were the best decisions I made! It helped me understand the basics of  HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and DOM. For my final project, I created an entertainment website called Huffien Club.  </p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Huffien.Club is a parody of dating app. I used dogs as my target audience to communicate and get my goal across. I understand, as learned during my research, people download dating apps because they want real connections. Each dating app has its own unique selling point. Hinge was my favorite example of a dating app because it, according to their advertising campaign, is designed to be deleted. Huffien.club is the opposite of Hinge; it wants you to join the club and have fun without feelings attached. 
                                             </p>
                                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *Don’t you wish you don’t catch feelings too?
                                    I had so much fun creating the website. I hope this website gives you a smile, if not you are one more Dating apps richer :)
